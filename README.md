# Evolving structures in complex systems

This repository contains the code to reproduce the Figures and numerical results
from the paper: _Evolving structures in complex systems_ by Hugo Cisneros, Josef
Sivic and Tomas Mikolov.

## Build the C library

The C library provided implements a general cellular automaton simulator and all
the steps for computing the metrics we discuss in the paper. 

The library can be built with
```make all```

## Python scripts
